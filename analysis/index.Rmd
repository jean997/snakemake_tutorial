## Introduction

This website contains a short introduction to Snakemake intended for a biostatistics/statistical genetics audience. This tutorial is intended to be a "quick start". We should be able to cover this material in about an hour. With the material in this tutorial, you will be able to write a basic Snakemake pipeline and execute it either locally or on a cluster. 

Due to time constraints, there is lots of material that we won't cover in this guide. Once you are started, there are several excellent resources for learning more.
